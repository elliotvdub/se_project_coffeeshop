# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think it would be cool to add more animations to the site. Along with more videos in the recipes section that contain videos of the coffee shop's own recipes to showcase their uniquness!
